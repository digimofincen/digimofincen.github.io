While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=itazura-na-kiss-1>Itazura Na Kiss<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#itazura-na-kiss-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://static.tumblr.com/c64ed25ca4385acc39a11f6032e3d3d4/0s84qaa/djympy1pu/tumblr_static_tumblr_mpwuwt0xqg1ql3croo1_500.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.xk7SXKQ4Wsw5oR9gMuPT1AHaJO&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="Itazura na kiss"><p><em>Source: teasing-kiss.tumblr.com</em></p><blockquote><p>anime kiss itazura na romance mature manga tumblr irie characters wallpaper passion fuel inside kotoko couple aihara naoki romantic marito.</p></blockquote><p>What are wallpaper screens and why are they so popular?
