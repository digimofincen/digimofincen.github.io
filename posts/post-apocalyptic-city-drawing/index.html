-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=post-apocalyptic-desert-city-by-iluze-on-deviantart>Post Apocalyptic Desert City By Iluze On DeviantArt<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#post-apocalyptic-desert-city-by-iluze-on-deviantart>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://img07.deviantart.net/f7a2/i/2014/215/1/a/post_apocalyptic_desert_city_by_iluze-d7thmih.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.f9ZkzhW-KtgdEixo-bsgNgHaEo&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="Post apocalyptic desert city by Iluze on DeviantArt"><p><em>Source: iluze.deviantart.com</em></p><blockquote><p>desert apocalyptic city iluze deviantart concept wallpaper scp.</p></blockquote><p>Cool Wallpaper is a type of wallpaper that is designed to be aesthetically pleasing and easy to use.
