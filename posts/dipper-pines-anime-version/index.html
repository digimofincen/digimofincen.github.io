-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=gravity-falls--mabel-pines-and-dipper-pines--anime-version>Gravity Falls || Mabel Pines And Dipper Pines || Anime Version<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#gravity-falls--mabel-pines-and-dipper-pines--anime-version>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8f/e9/26/8fe9266e68e22266c138c35e52a44bb0.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.4gFqOWEfNIZG60Ikh1xENgHaL5&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="Gravity Falls || Mabel Pines and Dipper Pines || Anime version"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>mabel gravity falls anime dipper version.</p></blockquote><p>The Best Way to Store Wallpapers: A Storage Solution for Your Collection
