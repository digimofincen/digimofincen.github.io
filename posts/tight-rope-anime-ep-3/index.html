-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=tight-rope-anime-episode-2--yaoi-no-yoru-ƹӂʒ-dd-tight-rope-ova-02-1>Tight Rope Anime Episode 2 : Yaoi No Yoru Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ: DD Tight-Rope OVA 02/<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tight-rope-anime-episode-2--yaoi-no-yoru-ƹӂʒ-dd-tight-rope-ova-02-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://cdn.anisearch.de/images/anime/screen/7/7597/full/255151.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.NlmpTeP_nl3FBY2Zv4aqKAHaEM&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="Tight Rope Anime Episode 2 : Yaoi No Yoru Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ: DD Tight-Rope OVA 02/"><p><em>Source: logospaces.blogspot.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Anime wallpaper is a popular way to add some extra excitement to your home screen.
