While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=resenha-inu-x-boku-ss-1---um-sofá-à-lareira>[Resenha] Inu X Boku SS #1 - Um Sofá À Lareira<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#resenha-inu-x-boku-ss-1---um-sofá-à-lareira>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/34600000/Inu-X-Boku-inu-x-boku-ss-34698598-1085-789.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.eUgMwHUfLXSwio3yC7sIjgHaFY&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="[Resenha] Inu X Boku SS #1 - Um Sofá À Lareira"><p><em>Source: umsofaalareira.blogspot.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Best way to show off your wallpaper:
